    <dt> WEB TECHNOLOGY </dt>
    <dd> Web technology has revolutionized our digital landscape, shaping how we interact, communicate, and 
        transact online. From its humble beginnings with static HTML pages to the dynamic,
         data-driven applications of today, its evolution has been remarkable. HTML lays the groundwork by 
         structuring web content, while CSS enhances presentation with stylish designs. JavaScript injects 
         interactivity, making web experiences engaging and dynamic. Server-side scripting languages such as
          PHP, Python, and Ruby process data and generate dynamic content. Content Management Systems streamline
           website creation and maintenance, simplifying content publishing. Frameworks like React and Angular 
           empower developers to build sophisticated web applications. APIs facilitate seamless integration between various web services, fostering collaboration. Responsive design ensures websites adapt to different devices, enhancing accessibility.
         Emerging technologies like PWAs and WebAssembly promise even more innovative web experiences ahead.</dd>
         <dt>SAD</dt>
<dd>System Analysis and Design (SAD) is a methodology used in software engineering for analyzing, designing,
     and implementing information systems. It involves understanding user requirements, modeling system 
     processes, and creating efficient solutions to address organizational needs. SAD typically follows a 
     
     structured approach, starting with requirements gathering, followed by system design, implementation, and maintenance phases. Techniques such as data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and UML (Unified Modeling Language) are commonly used in SAD to visualize and document system specifications. The goal of SAD is to create systems that are reliable, scalable,
     and aligned with business objectives, ultimately enhancing productivity and efficiency within organizations.</dd>

<dd>Data analysis encompasses the process of examining, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to derive 
    meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures
     or formulas for solving computational problems or performing tasks efficiently. They form the backbone of
      data analysis, enabling the processing of large datasets and the implementation of complex statistical
 techniques. Together, they empower organizations to uncover patterns,
     trends, and correlations within data, driving strategic initiatives and improving operational efficiency.</dd>
